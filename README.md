# How to build
This should ensure both googletest works for unit tests and that SFML works properly.

The VS files will be generated by CMake. Install CMake and make sure - during installation - to check "Add to PATH" so that CMake can be called directly from bash. Enter CMD or Git Bash (Git Bash which comes with git has less cancerous commands) and cd into SOMEFUCKINGDIR/preppers/bin and type
    cmake ..
THe Visual Studio solution file should be in the follwoing folder: SOMEFUCKINGDIR/preppers/

Download SFML-2.4.1 or something and put the root folder in the project root directory. Copy the dll files to bin/src/Debug. SFML should be linked and ready for action now.
