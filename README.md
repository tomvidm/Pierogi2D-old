# sfml-game-engine
## Dependencies
* `SFML` - graphics, input, sound
* `Lua` - Scripting
* `Selene` - C++ binder for Lua
* `GoogleTest` - For testing

## How to build
This should ensure both googletest works for unit tests and that SFML works properly.

* Download `SFML-2.4.1` or something and put the root folder in the project root directory. 

* The Lua binder for C++ is header only and located in /includes/. They are included in this repository and does not need manual download.
Lua libraries must be downloaded to some folder and this folder must be added to system PATH manually. Dynamic libraries can
be downloaded from here:
`https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.2/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/`

* The VS files will be generated by CMake. Install CMake and make sure - during installation - to check "Add to PATH" so that CMake can be called directly from bash. Enter CMD or Git Bash (Git Bash which comes with git has less cancerous commands) and cd into SOMEFUCKINGDIR/sfml-game-engine/build and type
    `cmake ..`

* The Visual Studio solution file should be in the follwoing folder: SOMEFUCKINGDIR/sfml-game-engine/build
